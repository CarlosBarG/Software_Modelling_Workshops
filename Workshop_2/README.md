# Workshop #2 

This folder contains the development of Workshop #2, so there is the Technical_report document in which the user stories, CRC cards, class diagram, activity and sequence diagrams, as well as the analysis of the object-oriented programming principles and software design patterns for the Arcade_store_program  are specified.


Likewise, there is the src folder that includes the python implementation of Workshop #2.
