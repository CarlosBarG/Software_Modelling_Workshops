# Workshop # 1
## Author: Carlos Alberto Barriga Gámez

This folder contains the development of Workshop #1, so there is the Technical_report_Workshop_1 document in which the user stories, CRC cards, class diagram, activity and sequence diagrams, as well as the analysis of the object-oriented programming principles for the Arcade_store_program program are specified.

Likewise, there is the Arcade_store_program folder that includes the python implementation of Workshop #1.

### Below are the main user stories that guide the implementation of Workshop_1:

• As a customer, I want to be able to choose the material of the arcade machine, so what it adapts to my needs. 

• As a customer, I want to have a list of available games, so what I can choose the one I want to play.

• As a customer I want to be able to add the games that I buy to the arcade machine, so what I can then play them later.

• As a customer, I want to finalize the purchase of the arcade machine, so what I can have access to it.
• As a customer, I want to be able to register my data, so what the machine is my property.

• As a customer, I want the store to have a merchandising section for the store, so I can buy items that I like.

• As a customer, I want to know the price, name, year of manufacture of each machine, so what I can know if it meets my needs.
